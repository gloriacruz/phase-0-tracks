One problem that I encounter almost daily in my life is coming up with something yummy and healthy to cook for my family. When it's my husband's turn to cook, I see he also struggles a lot to find a good idea. We normally open the fridge, see what is available and stare at it for way too long, until we finally start to figure out a decent idea for a dinner.
I'm guessing that is a common problem for a lot of people who want to eat at home, instead of take-out, but don't have a lot of time.
We have tried many things to make this work: from coming up with a fixed menu at the begging of the week (we hardly stick to it), cook all the week's dinners during the weekend (food isn't fresh after few days), subscribe to Blue Apron (meals are super caloric and take too long to prepare), subscribe to weekly farmer's market boxes, etc...

A ruby program with persistent data storage to manage our favorite recipes. We normally only cook what we know we like, and what we have cooked and tried before. So makes sense for us to pick for past recipes. If one day, we want something new, we can add the recipe to our recipe manager.
The program can suggest a meal based on our food type cravings, food available on the fridge or completely randomly.
