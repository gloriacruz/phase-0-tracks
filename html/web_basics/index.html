<h1>Hello World of Cats!</h1>
<p>The cats are amazing creatures that live around us. They are very sweet, when they want to be sweet. The are great pets! They are easy to maintain and they don't need a lot of space. Some downside is, that is difficult to tell if a cat loves you, actually is <strong>almost impossible</strong>, maybe the cat only needs something from you...</p>
<p>I strongly believe their hobbies go in this order:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Food</li>
  <li>Knock glasses of water to the floor</li>
  <li>Look at birds all day</li>
  <li>Petting</li>
</ol>
<p>Other things they like, in no particular order are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Scratching</li>
  <li>Feathers</li>
  <li>Climb ladders</li>
</ul>
