# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

It's a mechanism to store and access code locally and remotely. Version Control keeps our code history, so we're able to go back in time to previous versions if we need to. It also makes it easy for several developers to work on the same codebase at the same time, without extensive merging work. It's also useful because when you use a remote repository, you're protected against computer accidents.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is created from the master codebase and is used to work on a special feature or set of features. We should use branches to keep our work organized, avoid merging conflicts and keep our master free of compilation errors, so anyone can pull a working copy anytime.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is a way to tell git: "This change/file has been edited, tested and is ready to be merged". A good commit message is specific about what changes were made or what feature was added.

* What is a merge conflict?

When a file or more contain conflicting changes. For example, changes were made possibly by 2 people creating branches at the same time and then edited the same file and lines of code.
