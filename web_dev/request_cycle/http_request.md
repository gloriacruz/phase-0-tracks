What is the difference between a GET request and a POST request? When might each be used?
The GET is used to request data from a specified resource, while POST submits data, from the client (browser) to the server, to be processed to a specified resource.
The POST can be used to submit a login web form and the GET can be used to request for a user profile.


Optional bonus question: What is a cookie? How does it relate to HTTP requests?
It's a small piece of information stored on a user's computer by the browser. The web browser may use it, for example, to save sessions and keep a user logged-in.
